# LibSVM-for-Processing
A set of processing examples that demonstrates the capability of multi-class classification on a 2D SVM.

by Rong-Hao Liang: r.liang@tue.nl

Without installing a library, you can perform SVM classification in processing with these examples.
The Example is based on the original LibSVM library
(LibSVM Website: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/)

- Example 1. Train a Linear SVM
Input: Labelled data formed by Click and Drag the mouse cursor on the canvas.
Output: A Linear SVM model for classifying the mouse position.

- Example 2. Load a Linear SVM
Input: A SVM model.
Output: Classifying the mouse position based on the model loaded.

- Example 3. Load a CSV file
Input: A Dataset in CSV file format.
Output: A model for classifying the mouse position based on the model loaded.

- Example 4. Load a non-CSV file
Input: A Dataset in non-CSV file format.
Output: A model for classifying the mouse position based on the model loaded.

- Example 5. Train a RBF SVM
Input: Labelled data formed by Click and Drag the mouse cursor on the canvas.
Output: A RBF-Kernel SVM model for classifying the mouse position.

A Tool for generating CSV file is also provided
- CSV generator
Input: Labelled data formed by Click and Drag the mouse cursor on the canvas.
Output: A CSV file contains all the mouse position with label.
